            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            I am a senior at the University of Oklahoma studying Management Information
            Systems with an expected graduation of December 2021. I enjoy
            spending time with my family, hiking with my dog, and reading.
            I grew up playing competitve volleyball and love to play in
            sand volleyball tournaments on the weekends. Throughout my time
            at OU, I have been involved on campus through my sorority Kappa
            Alpha Theta, and have had the opportunity to serve the community
            through events like Soonerthon and Relay For Life. I have also
            worked as a Quality Assurance Intern at Rural Sourcing Inc., where
            I have had the opportunity to grow my skills and learn in a
            professional environment.
